-- | The AppM monad is our main application monad, which combines the Halogen monad with
-- | the Store monad. It allows us to manage the state of the application and perform
-- | actions on it. 
-- |
-- | As of now, the AppM monad is only used for navigating between different pages in the
-- | application. However, it can be extended to include other functionalities as needed
-- | (e.g. logging, communication with the backend, resource management, etc.).
