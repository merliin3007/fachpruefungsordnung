# Blocks

A block is either a [paragraph](#paragraphs), a [table](#tables),
or an [appendix](#appendices).


## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are composed of [styled text](./text.md).
Unlike general text, paragraph text is made up of sentences.

Sentences are generally terminated by a single period (`.`), each.
Exceptions apply in the context of [text children](./text.md#child-nodes) (TODO).


## Tables

TODO.


## Appendices

Other [documents](./document.md) may be included, as *appendices*.
These are written separately.
