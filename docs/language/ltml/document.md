# Documents

An LTML document is composed of a [header](#header) and a [body](#body),
where the former contains some metadata and the latter is a tree of *nodes*.


## Header

The header may contain the following nodes.

* Title


## Body

The body is composed of:

* an intro: a sequence of fixed-type [simple sections](./simple-section.md)
* a main part: a [section body](./section.md#body)
    * One may thus see a document as a fancy section.
* an outro: a sequence of fixed-type [simple sections](./simple-section.md)
