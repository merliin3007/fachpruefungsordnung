# Document containers

An LTML document container can be seen as a large document, which is made up
of smaller actual [documents](document.md).

More precisely, it is composed of

* a [header](#header), which contains some metadata,
* a main [document](document.md), and
* a list of [appendix sections](#appendix-section).


## Header

The header may contain the following nodes.

* Title
* Output header (displayed on the top of each page)
* Output footer (displayed on the bottom of each page)


## Appendix section

An appendix section has a title and contains a list of documents
(appendices/attachments).
