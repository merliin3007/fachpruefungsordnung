# Sections

Sections generally have an [unstyled-textual](./text.md) heading,
and are composed of lower-level sections or [blocks](./block.md).

Sections are identified by [keywords](general/identifier.md#input-identifiers),
and not indented.
Compare Markdown's different headings (`#`, `##`),
MediaWiki's sections (`==`, `===`, ...), and
LaTeX' sections (`\section`, `\subsection`, ...).
