# Lists

Lists are [text children](./text.md#child-nodes).

Lists are composed of [textual](./text.md) items, which are either numbered
sequentually, or unnumbered
(c.f. LaTeX' `enumerate` and `itemize` environments).

List may indirectly contain sub-lists:
the text within lists may have a list as text child.
