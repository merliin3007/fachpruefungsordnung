# Text

Some nodes contain *text*, which may generally be [styled](#styling), and
contain [references](#references), [footnote references](#footnote-references),
and [enumerations](./enumeration.md).


## Text kinds

There are several text kinds (e.g., paragraph text), which are determined by
where text occurs, but do not depend on node types.

The text kind determines whether styling, footnote references, and
enumerations within text are permitted, each, and may further extend text.

References are always permitted.


## Line breaks & Whitespace

Text may be spread over several lines---maintaining indentation if any.
Such input lines form a single logical line, joined by whitespace.
Text is terminated by a final newline character.

Any internal whitespace---either from a single linebreak as described above,
or a non-empty sequence of ASCII spaces, but neither initial nor final---is
treated the same: as a word separator, which is generally rendered as a single
space character.
In particular, it is impossible to encode a line break; lines are
automatically broken in the output whenever an output line is full.

Empty lines are disallowed within text.
Note, however, that empty lines may be used to split up
[paragraphs](./paragraph.md), which are otherwise basically just text.


## Keyword-headed text

In some contexts (e.g., [enumerations](./enumeration.md)), text is headed by a
[keyword](general/identifier.md#input-identifiers).

In this case, one level of [indentation](general/indentation.md) is implicitly
added.

The first line may generally be written right after the keyword (in the same
line, separated by at least one ASCII space); otherwise, it starts on the
subsequent line, indented.

See [enumerations](./enumeration.md) for example input.


## Styling

* Some (but not all) node kinds permit styled text.
* Specifically, text may be `<*bold>`, `</in italics>`, or `<_underlined>`.
* Different style tags may be nested (e.g., `<*bold </and italics/>*>`).
    * However, a style tag may not be (transitively) nested within itself
      (e.g., `<*bold <*again*>*>` is illegal).
        * Note: This restriction is not yet implemented and might be removed
          later.
* ```
  <*Styled text can
  span multiple lines,
    # contain enumeration items,
  and continue afterwards---at the same indentation level.>
  ```


## References

[Labeled](general/label.md) nodes may be referenced within text, as
`{:LABEL}`, where `LABEL` is the respective label.
In the output, the respective output [identifier](general/identifier.md) is
substituted.


### Example

```
{p:}
This is a labeled paragraph.

This is a reference to paragraph {:p}.
```

Output:

```
This is a labeled paragraph.

This is a reference to paragraph 1.
```


## Footnote references

* [Footnotes](./footnote.md) may generally be referenced within text, as
  `{^:LABEL}`, where `LABEL` is the respective footnote's label.
    * Note that the `^` character is fixed, and unrelated to the footnote
      type's keyword (which is also commonly `^`).
* A footnote reference is substituted by a correspondingly formatted output
  [identifier](./general/identifier.md) in the output.
* Footnote references have [document](./document.md) scope:
    * Footnote references must reference footnotes defined in the same
      document.
    * Footnote output [identifiers](./general/identifier.md) are unique within
      a document, but generally not over several documents.
* A footnote may be referenced repeatedly.
* Note that footnotes may also be referenced using ordinary references, in
  which case they are not formatted as footnote references.
* [Example](./footnote.md#example).


## Child nodes

Text nodes (e.g., headings, sentences) generally permit in-line children.
That is, at any point in such a text node, certain child nodes may be inserted.
This requires breaking the line where the children are to be inserted.

Text children must be [indented](general/indentation.md) one level from the
current context (text); that is, two levels from the textual node's keyword,
if any.

There is currently one kind of text children, [enumeration](./enumeration.md)
items.


### Example

```
Everybody loves these fruits:
  # Apples, unless
      # unripe, or
      # not tasty
  # Bananas,
    if yellow
  # Oranges
```

This example is to be read as containing a single nested enumeration.
