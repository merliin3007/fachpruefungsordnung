# Legal Text Markup Language (LTML)

LTML is a language designed to write legal texts, specifically German
"Fachpr√ºfungsordnungen", but to be flexible enough to use for any kind of
structured text.

LTML documents are written partially via a GUI, and partially via a text
editor.

LTML documents are to be converted to an output format (specifically, PDF).
