# Language

We define the [Legal Text Markup language (LTML)](language/ltml.md), which is
actually a family of languages, where each language is defined by an
[LTML Schema Definition (LSD)](language/lsd.md), specified in the eponymous
language (compare XML and XSD).


## Formal grammar specification

To specify formal grammars, we generally use a
[variant of EBNF](language/ebnf.md).
